# Remove the grid from the global 'image'.  Return the result image
# AND a list of [ [angle1,distance1], [angle2,distance2] ] describing
# the two principal grid lines.
#
# The angle is the angle, in degrees, of the grid line
# counterclockwise from the horizontal.
#
# The distance is the distance from the origin, in pixels, of the
# first peak in the Fourier Transform corresponding to the lines at
# the given angle.  This will later be used to calculate the line
# spacing.
#
# Do the following in the compute() function:
#
#   1. Compute the FT of the image.  Store it in 'imageFT'.
#
#   2. Compute and store the FT magnitudes.  Find the maximum
#      magnitude, EXCLUDING the DC component in [0,0]. 
#
#   3. Set to zero the components of 'imageFT' that have magnitude
#      less than 40% the maximum magnitude.  Store this new FT in
#      'gridImageFT'.  Record in a list the (x,y) locations of the
#      non-zero magnitudes of 'gridImageFT'.
#
#   4. From the locations of the non-zero magnitudes, find the angles
#      of the two principal grid lines and, for each such line, find
#      the distance of the closest non-zero magnitude to the origin.
#
#      THIS IS DIFFICULT and can be left until you have zeroed the grid
#      line pixels as described in Step 6.
#
#   5. Apply the inverse FT to 'gridImageFT' to get 'gridImage'.
#
#   6. For each (x,y) location in 'gridImage' that has a bright pixel
#      of value > 16 (i.e. is one of the grid lines), set the
#      corresponding pixel in the original 'image' to the average of
#      the pixels on either side of the grid line that are not also
#      grid line pixels.  Do not modify 'image'; instead, store your
#      result in 'resultImage'.
#
#      FINDING THE AVERAGE IS DIFFICULT, so first set the grid line
#      pixels to zero and debug your code to make sure that this is
#      working.  Only after this is working should you try to set the
#      grid line pixels to the average from either side.  You will need 
#      to know the angles from Step 4 to do this.
